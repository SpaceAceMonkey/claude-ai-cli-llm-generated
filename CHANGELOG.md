## [0.4.0] - 2025-07-11

### Added
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Implemented extensive unit, integration, and property-based tests
  - 75+ tests covering dialog handling, file operations, navigation, and error scenarios
  - Property-based tests using QuickCheck for robustness validation
  - Organized test modules in `src/handlers/events/tests/`
  - Test coverage for save/load dialogs, exit confirmation, directory creation, and file operations
- **Test Documentation**: All tests annotated with detailed comments explaining purpose and expected results
- **Improved Dialog Layout**: 
  - Exit dialog now dynamically sizes to content with 90% screen width limit
  - Better text wrapping prevention and dialog centering
  - Enhanced visual consistency across different terminal sizes

### Improved
- **Code Organization**: Better separation of dialog logic and UI rendering
- **Error Handling**: More robust error scenarios covered by tests
- **Performance**: Test suite validates performance characteristics under various load conditions
- **Maintainability**: Comprehensive test documentation makes codebase more maintainable

### Technical
- **Dependencies**: Added `tempfile` and `quickcheck` as dev-dependencies for testing
- **Test Infrastructure**: Modular test organization with helper functions and fixture management
- **Validation**: All dialog interactions validated for state consistency and error handling

## [0.3.0] - 2025-07-08

### Added
- **Save/Load Conversation System**: Complete JSON serialization with `/save` and `/load` commands
- **File Browser Dialogs**: Full filesystem navigation with directory traversal, file selection, and breadcrumb display
- **Directory Management**: "Create New Directory" functionality integrated into save dialog
- **Exit Confirmation Dialog**: Escape key now shows Yes/No confirmation instead of immediate exit
- **Error Dialog System**: Overlay dialogs for displaying API errors and file operation failures
- **Unicode Text Support**: Proper character-based string operations for international text input
- **Dialog Priority System**: Hierarchical event handling (error → exit → file dialogs → main interface)
- **Empty Conversation Support**: Allow loading and saving conversations with no messages

### Changed
- Escape key behavior: now shows exit confirmation dialog instead of immediate termination
- File dialogs start from current working directory instead of home directory
- Enhanced status messages with detailed feedback for all operations

### Fixed
- String manipulation now properly handles multi-byte Unicode characters
- Cursor positioning in all dialog input fields
- Dialog overlay rendering and event priority handling

## [0.2.0] - 2025-07-07

### Added

- **Real-time Chat**: Interactive conversation with Claude AI through Anthropic API
- **Message History**: Persistent conversation thread with role-based formatting
- **Input Controls**: Multi-line input with keyboard navigation (arrows, home/end, backspace/delete)
- **Auto-scrolling**: Intelligent scroll behavior for new messages
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback during API calls
- **Command Line Arguments**: Configurable API key, model, temperature, max tokens
- **Simulation Mode**: Testing mode without actual API calls
- **Token Tracking**: Display of input/output token usage
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code block formatting in responses
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Easy copying of AI responses
- **Conversation Management**: Clear conversation functionality
- **Shift+Enter Support**: Send messages with keyboard shortcut
- **Feature Flags**: Configurable auto-scroll behavior

### Technical Features
